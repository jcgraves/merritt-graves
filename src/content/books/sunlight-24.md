Dorian Waters can't compete—not for college, not for work, and definitely not for Lena's attention. Not without Revision, the nano-implant and genetic augmentation package that separates society's players from its growing ranks of bench riders.

So Dorian starts robbing houses with a friend to pay for it, taking so little that no one notices. No harm, no foul. Even as they hit increasingly ambitious targets. The only problem is, it feels like wearing someone else's clothes—and the risks keep multiplying. And when Dorian's confronted with the choice to permanently Revise his personality, he realizes he needs to slow down and figure out who he truly wants to be first.

But with the police one step behind and a contentious relationship with his brother, Jaden, threatening to unravel everything, it's the expedient choices that Dorian's finding himself more and more compelled to make.
